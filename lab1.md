# PII, PHI, and PSI

Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information that can be used to positively identify an individual. Examples of PII include:<br>

Name<br>
Social security number<br>
Birthdate<br>
Credit card numbers<br>
Bank account numbers<br>
Government issued ID<br>
Address information (street, email, phone numbers)<br>

<br>
<br>


One of the more lucrative goals of cybercriminals is obtaining lists of PII that can then be sold on the dark web. The dark web can only be accessed with special software and is used by cybercriminals to shield their activities. Stolen PII can be used to create fake financial accounts, such as credit cards and short-term loans.<br>

A subset of PII is protected health information (PHI). The medical community creates and maintains electronic medical records (EMRs) that contain PHI. In the U.S., handling of PHI is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects a broad range of personal information in including health records.<br>

Personal security information (PSI) is another type of PII. This information includes usernames, passwords, and other security-related information that individuals use to access information or services on the network. According to a 2019 report by Verizon, the second most common way that threat actors breached a network was by using stolen PSI.<br>
